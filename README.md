Honestly... I don't know what "dank" means in the context of internet jargon.

UPDATE: NOW WindowBuilder COMPATIBLE! =D 

Added `PatientPortal.java` which is a reworking of `PatientReg.java` that utilizes the java.swing package's "GridBagLayout" layout manager for an elastic layout and also introduces many helper functions to reduce code repetition.

Note: It is still a work in progress. I have yet to add the LayeredPanels effect present in the original, and still need to implement the functions for improved database communication. I hope to post an update with those tomorrow noon (4/21/2020).
